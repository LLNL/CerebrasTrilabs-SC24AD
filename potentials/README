This directory contains potential files (data files) that can be used
for running the benchamarks in this appendix. We have bundeled them
with this appendix as a convenience; they can be downloaded from other
sources, as well as recrafted from descriptions in journal
publications.

The potential files (data files) are under different licenses. Each
potential file is annotated with an SPDX license descriptor, and each
potential file has a readme file describing its origin and potential
modifications. The full licenses can be found in the LICENSE-X files,
where X is an abbreviation of the license in question.
