(*) Modification: Compared to the publicly available references above,
we modified the file in the following ways: We changed the cut-off
radius to rc = 5.524750 A. For the rho(r) and phi(r) we maintained
only every 14'th point of each function table, starting with the
first, and omitted points for r > rc. For the F(rho) function, we
maintained only every 20'th points, starting with the first. That
means we have 501 points in each of the function tables as opposed to
10001 in the original file.
